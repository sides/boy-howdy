Boy Howdy is in an alpha stage and shouldn't be used for any purpose, probably not when it's released either.

## About

This repository contains many different packages that together form Boy Howdy, an extensible Discord bot.

The `boy-howdy` package is a skeleton bot that uses the `boy-howdy-core` library, which in turn is built on top of [`discord.js`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). It also comes with some pre-installed extensions that form the basic functionality expected of a bot. Namely, this is the `boy-howdy-ext-commands` package, which adds a command interface to the bot.

## Installation

```
$ not yet
```

## Development

The core is written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).

It still uses some local packages so I'm not sure how well it works on another machine.
